        I fell in love with Technology as far back as <strong>2005</strong> when
        I first encountered the internet. It was like magic to to me and since
        then i have always been passionate about all technology and how much it
        has transformed the way humans work, communicate, play, do business etc.

        Hi again, I would love to tell you about the things I have learnt so far
        in my <b>stutern journey.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been a really interesting journey learning about git and github,
        how to use the command line, how to use a code editor
        <i>(My favourite is VScode)</i> to write codes, building skeleton
        Webpages using <strong>HTML</strong> tags and most interestingly making
        my webpage look beautiful using <strong>CSS</strong> as you would see in
        this mini-project.

      <!-- <h3>Third section</h3> -->

      <p class="intro">
        Let me try to explain the difference between
        <em>paddings, margins and borders.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Padding</b> provides space around the element. <br />
        <b>Borders</b> simply wrap the element. A border can wrap immediately
        around an element, or it may look further away from an element if more
        padding has been applied to the element. <br />
        <b>Margins</b> are on the outside. Think of the margins you use on a
        piece of paper. These margins give space away from the edge of the
        paper.
